        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Yogendra Kumar, a passionate researcher and student currently pursuing an Integrated BS-MS in Physics with a minor in Data Science at IISER Mohali. My academic journey is marked by a strong focus on machine learning and its applications in diverse fields, ranging from particle physics to computational methods.

            My research experience includes working on machine learning in R-Parity Conserving SUSY Searches at LHC, where I utilized various algorithms to optimize SUSY search. Additionally, I have interned in areas like particle identification using machine learning techniques, and computing EIS of batteries, highlighting my diverse interests and ability to adapt to different scientific challenges.
            
            Beyond academics, I am deeply involved in extracurricular activities, serving as the co-convener of the Robotics Club at IISER Mohali. I also volunteer at significant events and offer tutoring to help others in their academic pursuits.
            
            I'm skilled in Python, C++, and various other technical tools, and continuously seek to expand my knowledge and contribute meaningfully to the scientific community.
